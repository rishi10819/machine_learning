Generate a random dataset.

Estimate the 75th quantile, which we know is qnorm(0.75), with the sample quantile: quantile(y, 0.75).
Perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 repetitions, generating the random dataset and estimating the 75th quantile each time. 
What is the expected value and standard error of the 75th quantile?
