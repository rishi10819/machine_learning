Obtain mortality counts for Puerto Rico for 2015-2018.
Use the loess function to obtain a smooth estimate of the expected number of deaths as a function of date. 
Plot this resulting smooth function. 
Make the span about two months long.


Now plot smooth estimates against day of the year, all on the same plot, but with different colors for each year.
