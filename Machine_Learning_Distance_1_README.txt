"tissue_gene_expression" matrix has the gene expression levels of 500 genes from 189 biological samples representing seven different tissues. 
Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and store it in the object d.

Compare the distances between observations 1 and 2 (both cerebellum), observations 39 and 40 (both colon), and observations 73 and 74 (both endometrium).

Make a plot of all the distances
