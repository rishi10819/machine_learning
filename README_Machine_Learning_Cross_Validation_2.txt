Use the train function with kNN to select the best k for predicting tissue from gene expression on the tissue_gene_expression dataset from dslabs. 
Try k = seq(1,7,2) for tuning parameters. 
For this question, do not split the data into test and train sets.
What value of k results in the highest accuracy?
