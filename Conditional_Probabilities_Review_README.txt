Assume a patient comes into the doctorâ€™s office to test whether they have a particular disease.

The test is positive 85% of the time when tested on a patient with the disease (high sensitivity): 
P (test+|disease) = 0.85

The test is negative 90% of the time when tested on a healthy patient (high specificity):          
P (test-|healthy) = 0.90

The disease is prevalent in about 2% of the community:                                             
P (disease) = 0.02

Using Bayes' theorem, calculate the probability that you have the disease if the test is positive.


What is the probability that a test is positive?

What is the probability that an individual has the disease if the test is negative?

What is the probability that you have the disease if the test is positive?
 
If the test is positive, what is the relative risk of having the disease?
