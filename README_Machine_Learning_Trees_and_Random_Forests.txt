Create a simple dataset where the outcome grows 0.75 units on average for every increase in a predictor.
Fit a regression tree and saves the result to fit.

 
Create a plot.

 
Make a scatter plot of y versus x along with the predicted values based on the fit


Now run Random Forests instead of a regression tree and remake the scatterplot with the prediction line.


Create a plot.


Re-run the Random Forest but this time with a node size of 50 and a maximum of 25 nodes and remake the plot.
