The reported_heights and heights datasets were collected from three classes taught in the Departments of Computer Science and Biostatistics, as well as remotely through the Extension School. 
The Biostatistics class was taught in 2016 along with an online version offered by the Extension School. 
On 2016-01-25 at 8:15 AM, during one of the lectures, the instructors asked student to fill in the sex and height questionnaire that populated the reported_height dataset. 
The online students filled out the survey during the next few days, after the lecture was posted online. 
Define a variable which we will call type, to denote the type of student, inclass or online.

What proportion of the online group is female? 

Use the type variable and report your prediction accuracy. 
Make an informed guess about sex based on the most prevalent sex for each type. 
 
Show the confusion matrix between y_hat and y. 

What is the sensitivity of this prediction? 
  
What is the specificity of this prediction? 
 
What is the prevalence (% of females) in the dat dataset defined above?
